<h1>Here are a bunch of things to do over the summer!</h1>

<ol>
<li> Have a water fight.<br>Round up some friends, get some water-balloons and some water-guns, and you're all set to go!  </li>
  
 <li>Have a pinic.<br>Find a good spot, check the weather and you can start your "Pinic Paridise"!<br>Good pinic foods are:<br>Watermelon<br>Lemonade<br>Sandwiches<br>And many more.
   
  <li>Go swimming. It's TONS of fun, relaxing and good for you!(ok, maybe not so much swimming. How 'bout hours and hours of water fun?!)</li>
